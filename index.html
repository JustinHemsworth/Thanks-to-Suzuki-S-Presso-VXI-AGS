											<h1>Hi, Iâ€™m Sai Saugat Mahapatra</h1>
											<p>This time I'm going to describe my experience when I travelled the 80% of the South..</p>
										</header>
										<p>I had my Dussehra Vacations from 1st October to 10th October. So my father (Mr. Sanjeet Kumar Mahapatra) and my mother (Mrs. Debasmita Dash) decided to travel and spend some time outside of Odisha. So, we all packed our bags to go to my village, we rested a little and had lunch, from there at the same day we started our travel towards south.The main and shocking thing is that we went in our car "Maruti Suzuki S-Presso".Though there was only 1 driver that was my father, it was then also so easy for him to drive 3,800 km by himself as our car was an automatic gear transmission car that gave him a profit of not pressing the clutch at every time the gear changes.
											Okay, now coming to main point. When we left my village , we decided to go Visakhaptnam and rest the night over there, but the situation wasn't like that so my father drove whole night from Visakhapatnam to Vijaywada, I was sleeping whole night and woke up at 05:00 am and saw that dad was still driving and mom was also awake. When we reached Vijaywada, we booked a hotel and rested there for some time. As I had slept before I was scrooling through my laptop .Mom and Dad were sleeping.We rested from 06:30am to 10:00 am and went for Tirupati balaji....</p>

											<h3>Tirupati Balaji</h3>
											<p>When we started our journey from Vijaywada, we took the blessings from god and started our journey. We reached Tirupati Balaji at night as the distance was 7 hr 30 min (414.1 km) via NH16. We booked a hotel on the way to the destination. The name of the hotel was Shree Vishnu Bhawan. We rested the whole night there and went for the temple at sharp 08:00 am the next day.
												 When we entered the temple we thought that we will leave the temple by an hour or a couple of hours but we didn't knew that people have to wait for there time for 5 hours or even a day. We made our decision to leave the temple because we were lacking time to travel the other places.People carried there bags with mattressses and pillows , when they reached the waiting room they caught there places and slept till the gate was opened.
												  When we said that , after a hour the people of the temple opened the gate. People were mad to see Shree Tirupati Balaji that they started to run. We saw the Lord and guess what we were allowed to see the god for only 10 seconds. It is said that this ritual was started from when the temple was built . People were waiting for long hours to see the god and they get only a handful of time to see the lord.Tirupati Balaji is also said to be the most rich god amongest all gods.
												   Foreigners come to visit the temple and donate so many tons of gold . Lord Tirupati Balaji's temple is also made of whole gold. We had the laddoo as the prasad and left the temple at 05:00 pm and went back to our hotel and carried our bags for our next destination "Bangalore".<a href="https://www.bing.com/maps?ty=18&q=OYO+84254+Sree+Vishnu+Bhavan+Tirupati&ss=ypid.YN4070x501003089&ppois=13.630651473999023_79.42530822753906_OYO+84254+Sree+Vishnu+Bhavan_YN4070x501003089%7E&cp=13.63066%7E79.425316&v=2&sV=1&lvl=16.0"> Hotel Shree Vishnu Bhawan,Tirupati</a> <img src="pic05.jpg" height="900" : width="600"><img src="pic24.jpg" height="900": width="600">     </p>

											<h3>Bangalore</h3>
											<p>We left Tirupati at night 08:00 pm and had some food on our way. We booked our hotel on our way and started our journey.It was a distance at 5 hr 39 min (316.6 km) via NH 48. The name of the hotel was Empire International. We reached Bangalore at night 12:30am and reached our hotel by 01:00am. We checked-in to our room and rested the whole night.
												 At that time we were feeling like a king, queen and prince of somewhere as the room we got was not less than a palace. The next day we started our visit of Bangalore.The first place we visited is HAL "Hindustan Aeronautics Limited". It contained so many planes , jets , helicopters that were used during the wars from the 60's to 2000. Some jets and cargo planes were also used in the 1971 War.
												  We met some people from Odisha as well.We all remember the Mission Mars, the spacecraft that was used in the misiion was also kept in that place. We clicked some photos, shooted some videos and left for lunch.After having our lunch , we went for the "Bengaluru Palace". It wasn't anything more than that of a normal castle or can be said as a palace. People got an audio player to listen the story of the palace.												  There were so many black and white photos and some coloured photos.This palace was named as a tourist place in 2013. Till 2013 the last king of the palace was shot dead by the enemies and the king didn't had a son. After a long visit of Bangalore , we went back to our hotel and rested a little and went to the Matrix Mall that was just a kilometer far from our hotel. So my dad decided to not take the car and should go by walking.In the mall I had McDonald's for the first time. We returned to our hotel after a good visit to the matrix mall.
												   We then rested the night and went towards the Lalbagh Botanical Garden. It was nothing more than a mountain but a beautiful and good photo shot spot and a good nursery for plants and some trees that were found in the Ancient times but not now.We also went to the Tipu Sultan's Summer palace and visited the place, that palace was also good but not good than the Bengaluru Palace. Bangalore was known as the silicon city because there was not a small company over there. Everything there were only expensive companies like:"Nike, Adidas, Lamborghini, Lexus, Ferrari, Starbucks, Dodge, etc." We left Bangalore the same day and went towards our next destination "Mysore"...<a href="http://empire-international.indiabangalorehotels.com/en/">Hotel Empire International,Bangalore</a>   <img src="pic06.jpg" height="400": width="600"><img src="pic09.jpg" height="400": width="600"><img src="pic11.jpg" height="900": width="600"><img src="pic25.jpg" height="420": width="600"> </p>

											<h3>Mysore</h3>
											<p>We left Bangalore at sharp 12:00 noon. We reached Mysore by 03:00 pm as the distance and timing was 2hr 51min(143.2km) via NH275. We reached our hotel by 03:30pm.The name of the hotel was "The Grand Maurya Resort" that was located at the outskirts of Mysore.THis hotel was the most expensive hotel in our whole trip.
											   We had our lunch over there and me and dad went for the swimming pool. Mom was filming my and dad's video when we were diving into the water. After this we left for the visit of Mysore and guess what , that was just not worth it. The day we were visiting Mysore was the great day of the god that the people of that place were beleving "MAA CHAMUNDESHWARI". So the Mysore palace was full with vehicles and peoples that a single finger couldn't be put into the ground .
											We didn't travel much in Mysore as their festival was going on and the whole city was in rush.We rested the night and left for "Hyderabad"<a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/in/grand-maurya-and-resorts.html">The Grand Maurya Resort,Mysore</a> <img src="pic07.jpg" height="400": width="600"><img src="pic22.jpg" height="900": width="600"> </p>

											<h3>Hyderabad</h3>
											<p>Okay, now we left for Hyderbad at morning 11:00am. We reached Hyderabad at night 01:00am at it was a distance of 14 Hr 17 min(717.9km)via NH44. As usual, we booked our hotel on the way. I couldn't remember the name of the hotel as I was whole asleep at that time as it was the middle of the night. We also met some people of Odisha who were the owners of the hotel. We rested the whole night and started our tour for Hyderabad. We also packed our bags as it would be night to return to the hotel. So, the place we first visited was "Charminaar". We thought that it would be a great place to tour but it was worse than ever. Hyderabad is known for the Charminar but that place was worse than a dumpyard. Mom felt so gross that she didn't even went inside. She just clicked pictures from the outside and went to the "Golconda Fort". 
										I was shocked to see that it took 50/- for just one perosn to visit the fort. We went into the fort and saw that a telugu song was being shooted over there. There were so many caves and secret ways to get in the caves which made it different from any historical fort or palace. We left the fort and went to the "Ramoji Film City". It took 1500/- per person.
									When we first entered the place. We thought that no need to travel the world and spend so much money, just come here and travel the whole world in one instance. We fisrt had our Lunch there and went to tour the place. We got a bus there and first travelled the sets that were made for the shooting of films. There was also the set of Mahabharat and some small sets for the scenes of K.G.F-2. Then we went to the place of games like hiking, bike riding, shooting, ropeway walking etc. I chose the ropeway walking and felt a little bit worried, so I had an idea to spread happiness so I started saying "Ram, Ram ,Ram" like Amir Khan said in the film Ishq. People laughed as well as my parents that made me happy.
								Then at the end of the ropeway walking there was a slide that was like people used chains to slide over a steel rope. After I finished that, We all went to the set of the most loved movies "Bahubali". The both movies of Bahubali were loved by almost every person in India.There were almost every things that were used in the movie like the Mahismati Mahasabha and the vehicles that Bhalaldeva used in the wars. There were also structures made of plastic of the bulls and horses that were used in the movie. It was night 09:00 pm when we left the Ramoji Film City. From then it was the time of return to our home so we went to Vijaywada to rest the night.<a href="https://www.ramojifilmcity.com/">Ramoji Film City,Hyderabad</a> <img src="pic08.jpg"height="400": width="600"> <img src="pic23.jpg"height="430": width="600">  </p>

					<p>It was night 02:00am while we reach to Vijaywada. We booked our hotel on our way.  
							 We rested our night and went for Vishakapatnam the next day.  We left Vijaywada at sharp 08:30am and left for Vishakapatnam. We reached Vishakapatnam at night around 05:00-06:00 pm and guess what , we didn't booked any hotel because my mamu and maein were living there so we rested there. We rested the whole night and the next day mamu bought some fishes. That was the first day in the 10 days I woke up in my own time before that i always woke up around 05:00am-07:00am by myself. Okay, we had our lunch and went for our village. On our way , my mom wasn't feeling well enough so she was resting from Vishakapatnam to our village. We left our village that day because I had to do my holiday homeworks on my last holiday that was on 10th october 2022. That day at 01:00am I was finally at my home after such a long Trip To The South...
